This document defines MG.  MG is a graphics library which provides a
common interface for doing interactive 3D graphics on a variety of
platforms.  The main intent is that it will be used with OOGL (Object
Oriented Graphics Lanauge), but there is nothing OOGL-specific about
MG, and conceivably other applications could use it as well.

MG is not meant to be as general or powerful as other 3D graphics
lanuages such as GL, XGL, RenderMan, PHIGS, etc. --- rather it is
meant to provide access to the most important operations common to all
of these languages.  MG is deliberately simple. It is *not* an attempt
to solve the 3D graphics standardization problem.  Until a widely
accepted standard does emerge, MG is an attempt to insulate ourselves
from the specifics of individual graphics lanuages, allowing us to
write programs that will run under a variety of these languages.

MG consists of several parts: a common part, and a part for each
device (language) on which it it implemented.  The library files are
constructed so that each device-specific library includes the common
part, so the application program only needs to link in the libraries
corresponding to the devices it wants to use (there is no separate
"common" library).

Any application program using MG should include the header file "mg.h".

The rest of this file contains a list of the MG procedures with a
description of the call syntax and an explanation of what each
procedure does.  This list is meant to be used both in writing
MG application modules and in writing MG device-drivers.

Most MG procedures have several versions.  The following conventions
are used in referring to them.

1. application version
   name convention: mgproc

	This is the version of the procedure which application
	programs call.  In most cases the name "mgproc" is actually a
	#define macro which expands to a function pointer which points
	to the corresponding device-specific version of proc.
	Application programs should only call these versions of
	MG procedures (the one exception is mgdevice_XX, for which
	there is only a device-specific version).

2. common version
   name convention: mg_proc

	This is a version of proc which performs operations,
	frequently bookkeeping type things, common to all MG devices.
	The device-specific version of proc may call the common
	version to accomplish these operations.  For the details of
	what the common mg_proc does, including information on when
	the device-specific version should call it, see the
	documentation of the source code for mg_proc in the mg/common
	directory.

	The common procedures also serve as the "null device".
	Before a device has been specified in an MG application
	program, the application version of proc is a pointer
	to the common procedure.  Running the program in this state
	draws no graphics but accomplishes all other operations
	associated with MG.

3. device version
   name convention: mgxx_proc, where xx = device (GL, XGL, etc).

	This is the version of proc specific to device xx.  It
	accomplishes the actual graphics operations, and calls the
	corresponding common routine if/when necessary to perform
	common operations.

	To write a new MG device driver you must supply a version of
	each device procedure for the new device.


The call syntax of each of these versions of proc is identical; the
prototypes below are given in terms of the application version.

 *
 *		Device must be set, via a call to mgdevice_GL,

 *		created, a context is valid only for the device for which
 *		it was created.
 *
 *		The value returned is a pointer to an opaque structure;
 *		it should not be modified in any way.  The only thing
 *		you can legitimately do with this pointer is pass it
 *		to other MG procedures, such as mgctxselect.
 *
 *		The MG_SHOW attribute is set to 1 by default, which means
 *		that (for relevant devices) the context's window becomes
 *		visible on the screen when mgctxcreatec is called.
 *		To prevent the window from appearing in the call to

===========================================================================

(1) should we go ahead and be systematic and have mgxx_begin
and mgxx_end and decree that each should call the
common routine of the same name? (device begin/end inside
common begin/end).

Done:

renamed		mgcopycontext	to	mgctxcopy
		mgselectcontext to	mgctxselect

		mgsetAp		to	mgsetappearance
		mgsetCam	to	mgsetcamera

added MG_SET and MG_MERGE for merge flag to setappearance.  Too much
confusion over whether 0 or 1 means set or merge!!
